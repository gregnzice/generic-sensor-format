Generic Sensor Format (GSF)

This sonar format and library was originally created by SAIC for the
US Navy.  Leidos was spun out of SAIC and they resleased version 03.06
under the LGPL 2.1 license.

Kurt Schwehr forked from this version to add unittesting and do a
general code audit and cleanup with the work done being Copyright
Google and under the same license.
